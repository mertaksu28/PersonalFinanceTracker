# Personal Finance Tracker

This project is a **console-based Personal Finance Tracker application** developed in Java as part of learning **core Java fundamentals**.

The application allows users to manage their personal income and expenses, view reports, and categorize expenses through a simple menu-driven interface.

---

## Features

- Add income
- Add expenses with description and category
- View total report (total income, total expenses, balance)
- List expenses by category
- Menu-based user interaction via console

---

## Concepts Used

This project focuses on practicing the following Java concepts:

- Variables and data types
- ArrayLists
- Loops (`while`, `for`)
- Conditional statements (`if / else`)
- Methods and method decomposition
- Static methods
- User input handling with `Scanner`
- Basic program flow control

---

## Project Structure

- `PersonalFinanceTracker.java`  
  Contains the main logic of the application, including:
    - Menu handling
    - Income and expense management
    - Report generation
    - Expense categorization

---

## Limitations

- Data is stored using **ArrayLists**
- No Object-Oriented Design yet (no `Income` or `Expense` classes)
- Data is stored only in memory (no file or database persistence)

These limitations are **intentional**, as the project was built to strengthen Java fundamentals before moving on to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

---

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements for future versions:

- Refactor using OOP principles
    - Create `Income` and `Expense` classes
    - Use `ArrayList<Income>` and `ArrayList<Expense>`
    - Apply encapsulation
- Add data persistence (file or database)
- Improve validation and error handling
- Enhance user experience

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended)
3. Run `PersonalFinanceTracker.java`
4. Follow the console menu instructions
